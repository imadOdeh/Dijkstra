1- We can use 'Dijksrta_graph.xlsx' as sample to import (upload) data to program.
	1-1- In the sample file "Istanbul" is start node.
	1-2- For indexing we consider '0' is first index.
	1-3- In Excel File: 9/300 means the direct distance (cost) to node with index 9 is 300.
2- We should choose Priority queue type to use it during executing Dijkstra Algorithm.
3- Final result (output) of shortest distances (costs) is saved in 'output.txt' in same folder that contains .exe file.
